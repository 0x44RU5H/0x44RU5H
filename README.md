# Hi there, I am [Aarush Gupta](https://aarushgupta.tk) aka `0x44RU5H` üëã
<p>I am a passionate, completely self-taught programmer, as well as a student.</p>
<p>I wish to one day make a tool that would change the way people think about connecting and learning; for now, I'm going to be finishing assignments given by the American Schooling System.</p>

### My username
<p>A lot of people ask me about my username, and I always tell them the same thing:</p>
- `0x` is often found in pointers
- The collection of numbers and letters that form my first name is self-explanatory
- Based on those two facts, we can affirmativly say that the point of my username is to allude to lower-level languages and computer architecture

### `git commit` is one of my most frequently used command (`git push` isn't that high up on the list) üèÜ
