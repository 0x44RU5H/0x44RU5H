# Hi there, I am [Aarush Gupta](https://theaarushgupta.com) aka `0x44RU5H` 👋
<p>I am a passionate, completely self-taught programmer, as well as a student.</p>
<p>I wish to one day make a tool that would change the way people think about connecting and learning; for now, I'm going to be finishing assignments given by the American Schooling System.</p>

### `git commit` is one of my most frequently used command (`git push` is a different story) 🏆
